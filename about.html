## About

Welcome to the personal site of Kartik Padmanabhan, data scientist, father, husband, son, roboticist, database engineer and career student. I have an insatiable curiosity and strive to learn as much about the data science field, database kernel, and systems engineering in general and have taken the effort to keep myself abreast of the latest developments in these fields. As a data scientist, I find that I can merge my love for statistics and data visualization, my database and programming experience, and my robotics education into the perfect venue to practice my skills. 

The other love of my life is my family. I have two wonderful sons and a supportive wife. We enjoy the occasional hike and bike trail, and make it a point to have Family Night Fridays going bowling, mini golfing, to the movies or something else.
