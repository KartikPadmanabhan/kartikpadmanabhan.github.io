title: List of Database Enqueues in Oracle 11.2.0.3
category: dba, administration, performance tuning
tags: ['database adminstration', 'enqueue', 'oracle', 'hang analysis']
---

Enqueues are shared memory structures (locks) that serialize access to database resources. They can be associated with a session or transaction. Enqueue names are displayed in the LOCK_TYPE column of the DBA_LOCK and DBA_LOCK_INTERNAL data dictionary views.

If you are working on 11203 database the following table lists all the enqueue waits in Oracle 11.2.0.3 and describes what the enqueue is for. Please email me if you have any questions.
