Hi Everyone!

I am taking a few moments in how do I approach to a very famous birthday problem.

<pre><code data-trim class="yaml">
web-app-mode: True

# Icons for Web App mode

icon-36p: "/img/web-app/icon-36p.png"
icon-48p: "/img/web-app/icon-48p.png"
icon-72p: "/img/web-app/icon-72p.png"
icon-96p: "/img/web-app/icon-96p.png"
icon-144p: "/img/web-app/icon-144p.png"
icon-192p: "/img/web-app/icon-192p.png"
</code></pre>

<small>If you want to disable this feature, simply set the web-app-mode variable to False</small>

This is how your website will look when added to the homescreen:

And when the user opens it (note that it renders in fullscreen):
